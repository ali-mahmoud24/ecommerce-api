## 📸 File Uploads Directory  

If you experience issues with missing upload directories, create the `uploads` folder manually.  
Run the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p uploads/{brands,categories,products,users}
```

This will generate the necessary nested folders:

📁 `uploads/`  
 ├── 📂 `brands/` (Stores brand images)  
 ├── 📂 `categories/` (Stores category images)  
 ├── 📂 `products/` (Stores product images)  
 ├── 📂 `users/` (Stores user profile images)  

Make sure to keep this folder **excluded from Git** to prevent accidental uploads.
